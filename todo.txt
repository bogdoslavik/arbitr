// LOOPS DEPRICATED
- choose price from order book / calc best trading amount
- accurately calculate profit for chain for amount (using trading orders book)

- decimal places in simulated balances

- order cancelling on timeout
- check order placing / cancelling logic

LOGIC:

- process deal: create order
    - network error: repeat 10 times, delay 1 sec
    - not filled in second
        - if first order: cancel chain
        - if next orders:
            get market orders, place order for worse price (decrease profit / fix a loss)
            //NF


- lost collection (move back free funds to start currency)



FUTURE FEATURES

- run on gateio

- recalc path back (find best way to back) when loop is broken
- move server close to exchange
- add server IP to whitelists
- register on exchanges that need API key (to improve results) and check for loops
- verify accounts
